## Analysis

After analyzing the data through the various tasks in this assignment, I observed the following trends:

* Charter schools seem to be more successful in having their students pass than district schools. The top 5 performing schools were all charter schools whereas the bottom 5 were all district schools.
* Schools spending more per student didn't necessarily translate into a better overall passing rate. From the results, it's actually the opposite--the schools that spent the most per student ended up having the worst perentage of overall passing rates whereas schools that spent the least, had one of the highest percentages of overall passing rates. Math seemed to be the difference. Reading had some impact and the percentage of students passing reading did drop between the least spent and the most spent. However, the discrepancy in the percent passing math between the least spent and highest spent was pretty significant.
* Looking at the size of school, small and medium sized schools were pretty even in their overall passing rate. But large schools, or those 2,000 students or more, had far fewer passing students overall.


## Tasks

I chose to analyze school data for this challenge. The data included school information as well as individual student information for each of those schools.

#### Files

Everything is in the PyCitySchools folder. The data source files are in the Resources folder in that PyCitySchools folder.

* [Jupyter Notebook] (PyCitySchools/PyCitySchools_starter.jpynb) - The Jupyter Notebook file that contains the scripts and results
* [Schools Data](PyCitySchools/Resources/schools_complete.csv) - this is the schools data file to be analyzed
* [Student Data](PyCitySchools/Resources/students_complete.csv) - this is the student data file to be analyzed


## Notes

I wasn't able to get all the formatting done on each displayed table. I could format the data in the tables but not the tables themselves. Did some Google searching to try and help with that but what I found didn't work. I wish I had more time to spend on that because the alignment of the headings is annoying as is and bothered me the most of all the formatting.
